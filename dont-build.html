          <p>
            In 2019, I wanted to create a website that closely followed our
            custom design and had smooth animations and interactions. I looked
            at <a href="#" class="link">UIkit</a>, but I didn't pick it for two
            reasons:
          </p>

          <br />

          <p>It had its own opinion on design</p>
          <p>It didn't meet my requirements for "smoothness"</p>

          <br />

          <p>
            This lead me to search for other frameworks that, unlike UIkit,
            provide just the basic JavaScript functionality, allowing you to
            style and animate as you wish. I didn't find anything. So,
            naturally, I decided to
            <a href="#" class="link"> make my own thing.</a>

            <br>

            <p>I was developing the framework in parallel with the website I was working on and it was wonderful. I was able to make the code just right and implement just the features I need. I took some inspiration from UIkit, but stuck to my main idea.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Later, I noticed that things weren't very efficient, so I decided to refactor. But because I was developing that framework and simultaneously using it, I had to rework not only the framework, but the website as well. Apart from that, I was trying to make this work for as many use cases as I could. What if you use React? What if you don't? What if you use jQuery? What if you don't even know JavaScript that much?</p>

            <br>

            <p>At this point, my enthusiasm slowly started to fade away. Without realizing it, I had put myself in a position where I wanted to solve problems that don't yet exist and solve them perfectly. But I still believed that in the end, it'd be "worth it".</p>

            <br>

            <p>Then, our team started to grow. I was no longer the only one working on that website. Since it used my framework, I had to onboard new people with it. This meant that I had to write up a README, then documentation, example usage, etc. Despite that, we still had to clear up some stuff in Slack.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Because our team grew, so did our workload. This caused work on the framework in parallel with the website to transition in work on the framework during the weekends and early mornings.</p>

            <br>

            <p>I carried on, though. I had (and to this point, still have) the habit of abandoning projects, so I was determined to at least boil the framework down to small organized JavaScript snippets that you could download via npm. But do I use  <a href="#" class="link">Custom Elements</a> or even go simpler than that and use just ES6 classes?</p>

            <br>

            <p>Recently, I started getting more and more into the React ecosystem. Late to the party, I know. I also started noticing more websites with</p>
